# Divulgue Sua Pesquisa
### A work in progress!

This is a personal project developed for Federal University of Ceara.

Only back-end has been implemented so far, with adjustments to come.

The project consists of a system with which professors and researchers at the University may send information about their current researches to the journalists responsible for the institution's communication platforms, with the intent of divulging their findings to the general public.

# How it works
The project uses MailKit as the primary service for sending e-mails. As of now, we are using only Ethereal mail for testing.

The idea here is that a production e-mail used by the journalists will be responsible for sending and receiving the information given by the researches.
